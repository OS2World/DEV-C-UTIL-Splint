Building splint:
----------------

This file is originally part of the binary distribution of splint 
for OS/2.

For building splint for OS/2 you need the complete "original" source
package (available e.g. via Dave Evans' splint homepage) and maybe 
some more recent patches for the OS/2 version. The splint home page
is at:

  http://www.splint.org

My fixes can be found at:

You also need a couple of Unix tools. These are available as free 
software (GNU tools) or freeware (IBM aixlike tools). In particular
the tools needed are:

 - A Unix shell. I use ksh, but others may do as well
 - The Unix `date', `cp', `mv', `rm' and `echo' commands
 - The `sed' and `tr' filters
 - GNU make (IBM/M$'s `nmake' does *not* work here)
 - Optionally, `flex' and `bison' (if not available, comment out
   the corresponding entries from the Makefile.os2 file)

Use the batch file makeos2.cmd from inside the os2/ directory to build 
splint. The options to that batch file are:

  makeos2 [--compile|-c|--test|-t|--package|-p]

This batch should be called from inside the os2 directory. I have
abandoned support for any compiler other than gcc 3.1.x or higher,
so that the build process has become much simpler. Use the "-c" or
"--compile" option to build splint, and optionally run the quicktest
by running the batch with "-t" (other tests are not supported).

Please, be aware that you need the flex library in order to build splint.
As far as I remember the OS/2 version of flex comes with this library for
the emx/gcc compiler. If not, you will easily be able to compile it 
following the instructions from flex'es README.OS2 file.

The Makefile.os2 is currently configured to use flex and bison to generate 
some source files. If you do not have these tools on your system you should 
change the corresponding section to use the .der files shipping with the 
splint sources.
